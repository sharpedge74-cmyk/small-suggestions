  <h1>Privacy Policy - Reptile Birds Protects Your Data</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>Reptile Birds.com</strong>. We value your privacy and have built all our tools to operate in a secure, transparent, and privacy-focused way. 
    This Privacy Policy explains how our tools work, what (if any) data is handled, and your rights under privacy regulations including GDPR, CCPA, and others.
  </p>

  <h2>1. How Reptile Birds Works</h2>
  <p>
    All tools on Reptile Birds are fully browser-based. This means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No file uploads:</strong> Your files never leave your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Local processing:</strong> All conversions and edits happen within your browser using JavaScript or WebAssembly.</li>
    <li><strong>No storage:</strong> Any temporary data is cleared once you close or refresh your browser.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Your data stays on your device.</strong> We cannot access, view, or share your files.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    In general, <strong>we do not collect any personal data.</strong> Minimal technical info may be used for operational purposes, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Browser type, screen size, and other non-identifiable technical data.</li>
    <li>Anonymous visit counts using privacy-friendly analytics (if enabled).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect IP addresses, personal identifiers, or behavioral data.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    Reptile Birds does not use cookies for tracking, fingerprinting, or advertising. Any future analytics will be anonymous and cookieless, fully GDPR and CCPA compliant.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    If third-party services or ads are used, they may set cookies independently. You can control or opt-out via:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Google Ad Settings</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" class="link">YourAdChoices</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any integrated third-party follows recognized privacy standards like the EU–US Data Privacy Framework.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Compliance with Privacy Regulations</h2>
  <p>
    Reptile Birds respects global privacy laws:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GDPR (EU):</strong> No personal data collection, no cross-border transfers.</li>
    <li><strong>CCPA (California):</strong> We do not sell or monetize user data.</li>
    <li><strong>PIPEDA (Canada), LGPD (Brazil), PDPA (Singapore):</strong> All respected where applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our tools are general-use and not aimed at children under 13 (or local consent age). We do not knowingly collect data from children.
  </p>

  <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Since we do not store personal data, there is no need to request access, correction, or deletion. For concerns regarding third-party services linked on our site, contact us.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    All processing occurs locally in your browser. No backend servers, databases, or endpoints are used, minimizing risk completely.
  </p>

  <h2>9. External Links</h2>
  <p>
    Links to other websites are provided for convenience. Reptile Birds is not responsible for their content or privacy practices.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Policy Updates</h2>
