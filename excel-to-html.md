<h1>Excel to HTML Converter â€“ Convert XLSX and XLS Files to Web Tables</h1>
<p>Transform your Excel spreadsheets into clean, responsive HTML tables instantly using our browser-based Excel to HTML converter. Whether youâ€™re publishing data on websites, preparing reports, or sharing interactive tables, this tool lets you upload, preview, and export Excel files (.xls or .xlsx) into structured HTML â€” all without installing software or uploading files to a server.</p>

<h2>What Is an Excel to HTML Converter?</h2>
<p>An Excel to HTML converter is a utility that converts spreadsheet files into web-ready HTML tables. Excel files store structured data in rows and columns with styling, formulas, and formatting. HTML tables, on the other hand, provide a lightweight, readable representation of that data for websites and applications.</p>

<h3>Understanding Excel and HTML Formats</h3>
<p>Excel files (.xls and .xlsx) support advanced features like formulas, charts, and cell formatting. HTML tables allow this structured data to be displayed on web pages while maintaining readability and hierarchy. Converting Excel to HTML ensures your data remains organized and visually accessible online.</p>

<h3>Why Convert Excel to HTML?</h3>
<p>Converting Excel spreadsheets to HTML allows you to share, embed, and present your data online without losing structure. Itâ€™s perfect for developers, marketers, educators, and businesses who want professional-looking tables from their spreadsheet data.</p>
