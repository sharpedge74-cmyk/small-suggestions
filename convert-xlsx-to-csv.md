<h2>Frequently Asked Questions about XLSX to CSV Data Conversion</h2>

<h3>1. What does the XLSX to CSV converter do?</h3>
<p>
This tool instantly converts Microsoft Excel files (<code>.xlsx</code>) into standard comma-separated values (<code>.csv</code>) format. It preserves your spreadsheetâ€™s data structure while removing unnecessary formatting, ensuring the output works with any database or application.
</p>

<h3>2. Is my Excel data safe during conversion?</h3>
<p>
Yes. All processing takes place entirely within your browser. No data is uploaded or stored on servers, so your Excel files remain fully private and secure.
</p>

<h3>3. Can I convert large Excel files to CSV?</h3>
<p>
Yes, the converter can handle large Excel files efficiently. However, extremely large spreadsheets may take a few extra seconds depending on your browser and system memory.
</p>

<h3>4. Does the converter support older .xls files?</h3>
<p>
Absolutely. In addition to modern <code>.xlsx</code> spreadsheets, the tool also supports the older <code>.xls</code> format, making it compatible with legacy Excel files.
</p>

<h3>5. How does this tool handle multiple sheets in Excel?</h3>
<p>
The converter automatically uses the first worksheet from your Excel file by default. You can save individual sheets separately if your file contains multiple tabs.
</p>

<h3>6. Will my formulas or formatting be included in the CSV output?</h3>
<p>
No. CSV is a plain-text format and doesnâ€™t support Excel formulas, styles, or colors. Only the raw cell values are exported to ensure a clean data structure.
</p>

<h3>7. Can I edit the data before converting it to CSV?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Once your Excel file is uploaded, the tool displays a live editable preview. You can modify cell values before exporting the final CSV file.
</p>

<h3>8. Is the tool free to use?</h3>
<p>
Yes, itâ€™s completely free and always will be. You can convert unlimited Excel files without registration, hidden costs, or ads.
</p>
